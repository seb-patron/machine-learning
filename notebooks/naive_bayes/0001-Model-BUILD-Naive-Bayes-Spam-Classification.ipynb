    "# Naive Bayes Spam Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a type of machine learning algorithm based applying [bayes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features. In short, a naive bayes classifier treats every features independent from each other, making inference very efficient. These types of classifiers are commonly used for spam detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF Tabu list was inspired by this [kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/clydewang/a-naive-bayes-way-for-spam-classification/notebook), with some improvements such as using pandas functions to clean the entire dataset instead of loop through it, and creating a better train and test split of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before we start...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly cover some of the basic definitions needed to understand our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Bayes Theorem is considered \"naive\" because it assumes that the presence (or absence) of a particular feature of a class is unrelated to the presence (or absence) of any other feature. In other words, every feature is taken into account without considering the existence of another feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathmatically, Bayes Theorem can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) \\, P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets break this down:\n",
    "- $A$ and $B$ are considered seperate events, and the Probability of $B$ (ie $P(B)$) ≠ 0.\n",
    "- $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of observing events $A$ and $B$ without regard to each other.\n",
    "- $ P(A \\mid B) $ is the probability of observing event $A$ given that $B$ is true\n",
    "- $ P(B \\mid A) $ is the probability of observing event $B$ given that $A$ is true\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying Bayes Theorem to spam classification, we can rewrite the problem statment as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\textrm{spam} \\mid \\textrm{w}1 \\cap \\textrm{w}2 \\> \\cap .. \\cap \\> \\textrm{w}n) = \\frac{P(\\textrm{w}1 \\cap \\textrm{w}2 \\> \\cap \\> .. \\cap \\> \\textrm{w}n \\mid \\textrm{spam}) \\, P(\\textrm{spam})}{P(\\textrm{w}1 \\cap \\textrm{w}2 \\> \\cap \\> .. \\cap \\> \\textrm{w}n)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a message m that is made up of n number of words, or m = $ (w1 \\cap w2 \\cap .. \\cap wn) $. We assume the occurence of any word wn is independent of all other words.\n",
